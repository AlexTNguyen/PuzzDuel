 		<h1>Overview: </h1>
		<p>Cat Fight! is a mobile game optimized for iPhone6's resolution, but played on a personal computer. It is a fast-paced, two-player, puzzle game where players challenge their friends. On each player’s screen, there is a tile board, the player’s health bar, and the opponent’s health bar. The goal of the game is to get your opponent’s health down to zero. To do so, the player must make chains of adjacent tiles. The player that can make the longest tiles in the shortest amount of time will ultimately win.</p>
