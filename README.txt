CatFight

Cat Fight is a head to head puzzle fight in which each player attempts to lower
their opponents health to 0. To do this a player must match 3 or more of the same
colored cats. Only cats that are up/down/left/right are considered adjacent (not diagonal).
The player does damage for each cat matched and if they match 5 or more they heal themselves
for that amount. This game is designed to play well on an iphone 5. To match the cats simply
swipe along the cats you wish to connect and the release your finger to complete the chain.


Running the game:
Relevant Scenes - Start, Game, Winner, Loser

Running the game requires 2 players so 2 instances must be open at the same time. If both 
screens say waiting for players then they both got their own lobby so you must exit one
instance of the game and open a new one. (Trying to connect both at the same time when
no rooms are available causes them each to make a room).
